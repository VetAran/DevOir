# DevOir
**Devoir:** This repository is my digital ledger, a meticulous (read: probably messy) record of my quest for scripting knowledge. It's a long road ahead, filled with inexplicable errors, fleeting victories, and perhaps the occasional flying cow, but, alas, I am armed with the spirit of the **Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch** for things... *unruly*.
